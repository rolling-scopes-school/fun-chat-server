## Server Application for the Chat. API

### Install and Run the Application

To use the chat server application follow these steps:

- clone the repository
- install the dependencies with `npm i`
- create the `.env` file and specify the [port settings](#Setting-the-Listening-Port-Parameters) and server [event log settings](#Server-Event-Display-Settings) in it
- start the local server using `npm run start`

The server runs on port 4000 and listens for messages from client applications.

In the `.env.example` file, you can find an example of basic parameter settings for the `.env` file.

To apply the modified parameters, you will need to restart the server.

### Setting the Listening Port Parameters

In the created `.env` file, set the `SERVER_PORT` parameter to `4000`.

If it is not possible to run the server using port `4000`, you can use another port.

### Server Event Display Settings

The server event log facilitates real-time tracking of incoming requests received by the server and responses sent by the server.

In the created `.env` file, set the `LOG` parameter to one of the values listed in this section.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Server Log Display Options</summary>

- `ALL` - all incoming and outgoing requests
- `ERROR` - only erroneous requests
- `INCOMING` - all incoming requests
- `OUTCOMING` - all outgoing requests
- `NONE` - request logging disabled

</details>

### Setting the Data Clearing Period

In the created `.env` file, set the `CLEAR_INTERVAL` parameter to the number of seconds after which the message history will be cleared and all users will be deleted.

This parameter is optional. You may need it if you want to host the application on your own server in public access.

### General Information

The server application utilizes the [WebSocket protocol](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/) where the initiator of the request can be either a client or server application. To use the protocol you will need to familiarize yourself with the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).

Upon a request to the server, the client will receive a response containing information about the processing result of the request. Some client requests may trigger the server to send additional requests to other clients - such situations are specified in the request description.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">General request format</summary>

```javascript
{
  id: string | null
  type: string,
  payload: {
    // Request payload
  },
}
```

where:

- `id` - request identifier, generated by the client application, the value will be returned by the server in the `id` field in the response. If a server application is the initiator, the id value of request identifier will be null.
- `type` - request name
- `payload` - request payload
</details>
